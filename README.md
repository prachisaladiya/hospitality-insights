# Hospitality Domain Power BI Dashboard
- This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing hotel performance across cities and platforms. It highlights key metrics like Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %, and uses DAX and data modeling to derive   business insights.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and shaping
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) for KPI calculations
- **Data Modeling** to build relationships and star schema

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Revenue and RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)
- Occupancy %, Realisation %, Cancellation %
- DSRN, DURN, DBRN (Room night metrics)

## Dashboard Features
- Week-on-week trend analysis
- Property-level KPI comparison
- Filters by city, room type, and week number
- Category-wise revenue breakdown (Business vs Luxury)
- Platform-wise ADR and Realisation %

## Data Preparation
Performed in **Power Query**:
- Removed nulls and duplicates
- Cleaned categorical fields
- Added calculated columns for better insights

## DAX Highlights
- Custom measures for KPIs (e.g., RevPar, Realisation %)
- Week-on-week change calculations
  
## Data Modeling
- Star schema with fact and dimension tables
- Relationships established for accurate filtering and cross-highlighting
